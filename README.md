### Introduction
The team will implement a web-based tool that allows a user to specify the functionality of software under test using the category-partition method. This tool will have a web-based client GUI for users and a C# based server for the toolâ€™s functionality. Based on input from the user, this tool will generate a file containing test cases specified in the Cucumber given-when-then notation.

A prototype of this project has been implemented already as a Windows console application with a C# back-end, but the interface is primitive and the back-end implementation has bugs. We will give you the code for this prototype, as a starting point for your project.
